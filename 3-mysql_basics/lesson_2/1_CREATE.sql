NOT NULL - Each row must contain a value for that column, null values are not allowed
DEFAULT value - Set a default value that is added when no other value is passed
UNSIGNED - Used for number types, limits the stored data to positive numbers and zero
AUTO INCREMENT - MySQL automatically increases the value of the field by 1 each time a new record is added
PRIMARY KEY - Used to uniquely identify the rows in a table. The column with PRIMARY KEY setting is often an ID number, and is often used with AUTO_INCREMENT
